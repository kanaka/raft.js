pgfplots - Create normal/logarithmic plots in two and three dimensions for LaTeX/TeX/ConTeXt.

pgfplotstable - Loads, rounds, formats and postprocesses numerical tables.

PGFPlots draws high--quality function plots in normal or logarithmic scaling
with a user-friendly interface directly in TeX. The user supplies axis labels,
legend entries and the plot coordinates for one or more plots and PGFPlots
applies axis scaling, computes any logarithms and axis ticks and draws the
plots. It supports line plots, scatter plots, piecewise constant plots, bar
plots, area plots, mesh-- and surface plots, patch plots, contour plots, quiver
plots, histogram plots, polar axes, ternary diagrams, smith charts and some
more.

Pgfplots is based on Till Tantau's package PGF/TikZ (pgf).

Pgfplotstable displays numerical tables rounded to desired precision in various
display formats, for example scientific format, fixed point format or integer,
using TeX's math facilities for pretty printing. Furthermore, it provides
methods for table postprocessing.

- scalability: lualatex now reduces compilation time for huge 3d graphics 
   (requires \pgfplotsset{compat=newest} at the time of this writing)

		(\addplot3[surf,samples=70] {exp(-x^2-y^2 +x*y)})
	
	surf shader=interp: time reduced to 25% of pdflatex
	 	(\addplot3[surf,shader=interp,samples=70] {exp(-x^2-y^2 +x*y)})

	surf shader=interp, parametric: time reduced to 36% of pdflatex
		(\addplot3[surf,shader=interp,z buffer=sort, samples=50,domain=-1:0,y domain=0:2*pi] ({sqrt(1-x^2) * cos(deg(y))}, {sqrt( 1-x^2 ) * sin(deg(y))}, x);)

- fixed bug: memory allocation in FPU consumed too much memory

- fixed bug: boxplots: now, it sets 'mark=*' for outliers if there is no mark (compat=1.12)

  dictionary entries including umlauts, undefined macros, math mode, ...
- simplified UI for symbolic coords: added magic prefix 
	[normalized]<number> to allow something like xmin={[normalized]0.7}

    \usepackage[cmyk]{xcolor} or \selectcolormodel{cmyk} will reconfigure pgfplots to use CMYK (document-wide)
